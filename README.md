# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

In this repo, I am using the code puzzles as a way of learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
Let's see, how it goes ...


## Installation
1. Clone repository
1. Run `cargo update`


## Compiling and Running 
Use `cargo` to compile and run the puzzle solutions.
There is a small CLI to select the corresponding puzzle parts, allowing to switch between test input or the full puzzle input:

```
cargo run <day> <part> --test
cargo run <day> <part> --full
```
